Fix state on load/delete labyrinth.

Delete server/constants/warnings???

In game.router:  Add a 3rd query to set a1 as cross and middle tile as end.
    -eh, maybe, a1 should be cross, but I don't know how important the end in the middle is.

~~In GameBoard.css might not need the rotation designations anymore.~~
